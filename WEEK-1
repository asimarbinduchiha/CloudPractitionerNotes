Basic Cloud Concept n Def of Aws
Def-a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow
Principles of cloud computing
Agility
Elasticity
Flexibility
Security

Advantages of CC
Trade capital expense for variable expense – not having to invest heavily in data centers and servers 
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale –a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. 
3. Stop guessing capacity – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs.
4. Increase speed and agility –new IT resources are only a click away 
5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

6. Go global in minutes – Easily deploy your application

- Shared Resposibilty Model of Aws
https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

Security of cloud
 AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud.
security in Cloud
amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities
This customer/AWS shared responsibility model also extends to IT controls
Inherited Controls – Controls which a customer fully inherits from AWS.
	Physical and Environmental controls

Shared Controls – Controls which apply to both the infrastructure layer and customer layers, but in completely separate contexts or perspectives.

Patch Management – AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications.
Configuration Management – AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications.
Awareness & Training - AWS trains AWS employees, but a customer must train their own employees.

EC2
Elastic Compute Cloud
a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier

Instance Types
General Purpose: A1, T3, T2, M5, M5a, M4, T3a
provide a balance of compute,memory and networking resources
Compute Optimized: C5, C5n, C4
Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors

Memory Optimized: R5, R5a, R4, X1e, X1, High Memory, z1d
Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.
Accelerated Computing: P3, P2, G3, F1
 to perform some functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs
Storage Optimized: H1, I3, D2
Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.

Hibernation of an instance??
ability to launch EC2 instances, set them up as desired, hibernate them, and then quickly bring them back to life when you need them. Applications pick up exactly where they left off instead of rebuilding their memory footprint.
which saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to your Amazon EBS root volume.

Load Balancer
It Distributes incoming application traffic accross multiple traffic EC2 instances in multiple availabilty zones.
it increases the fault tolerance of the application..
ELB detects the unhealthy instances and routes traffic to healthy instances
Healthy Instance??
Health Check
3 Types
Application Load Balancer
Network Load balancer
Classic Load Balancer
